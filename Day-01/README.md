## Day 1: Predicting Employee Attrition using Logistic Regression  

### Overview  
Today, I explored **Logistic Regression** to predict **employee attrition** using **machine learning**!  
The goal is to analyze factors influencing employee turnover and optimize the model with **feature selection and hyperparameter tuning**.  

### Key Steps  
**Data Preprocessing:** One-Hot Encoding, Feature Scaling  
**Model Training:** Logistic Regression  
**Evaluation:** Achieved **78% accuracy**  
**Insights:**  
- **Precision & Recall** show a balanced classification performance.  
- **Confusion Matrix** reveals misclassifications that can be improved.  

### Project Structure  
```
Day-1-Employee-Attrition/
│── README.md  # Documentation  
│── employee_attrition.py  # Standalone script  
│── emp_attrition.csv  # (from kaggle)  
```

### Dataset  
For this project, we use a dataset containing:  

**Features**: Employee Age, Department, Salary, Work-Life Balance, Job Satisfaction, etc.  
**Target Variable**: Attrition (Yes/No)  

### Technologies Used  
Python  
NumPy & Pandas (Data Manipulation)  
Scikit-learn (Model Building & Evaluation)  
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)  

### How to Run the Project?  
#### 1️ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aishvariyaa/30-Day-AI-Challenge.git
cd 30-Day-AI-Challenge/Day-01
```

#### 2️ Install Dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3️ Run the Script  
```bash
python employee_attrition.py
```

### Model Performance  
**Classification Report**  
- **Accuracy:** **78%**  
- **Precision:** **0.77 - 0.78**  
- **Recall:** **0.71 - 0.83**  
- **F1-Score:** **0.74 - 0.80**  

**Key Observations**  
- Work-Life Balance & Job Satisfaction are **strong predictors** of attrition.  
- Feature selection & scaling **significantly improved** model performance.  
- Hyperparameter tuning helped improve accuracy.  

### Next Steps  
Experiment with additional features like commute time & team culture.  
Apply **Random Forest or XGBoost** for better performance.  
Implement **SHAP values** for feature importance analysis.
